DESCRIPTION:The "Image Classification using TensorFlow" notebook presents an in-depth example of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It uses a systematic workflow, including data preprocessing, designing model architecture, training, evaluation, and visualizing predictions. The notebook starts with introducing the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The dataset has become a standard benchmark for image classification in machine learning. TensorFlow and Keras are used to create and train the model for classification. The data is loaded with TensorFlow's in-built `keras.datasets.mnist` module. For insight into the dataset's structure, sample images are visualized with Matplotlib. The images, initially in grayscale with pixel values between 0 and 255, are normalized by scaling them between 0 and 1. Labels are also converted to categorical form with `to_categorical()`, readying the data for model training.
A CNN model is built with TensorFlow's Keras Sequential API. The architecture includes:
1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract significant features from the input images.
2. **Max Pooling Layers**: Downsample spatial dimensions without losing essential information.
3. **Flattening Layer**: Transforms the 2D feature maps into a 1D array.
4. **Dense (Fully Connected) Layers**: Allow the network to learn sophisticated patterns.
5. **Softmax Activation**: Produces probability distributions for classification.
The model is built with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function for stable training. It is trained with the `model.fit()` function, tracking training and validation loss/accuracy over several epochs. The trained model is evaluated with the test dataset. Accuracy and loss curves are plotted to determine the performance of the model. A confusion matrix is created to know about misclassifications, which gives a better insight into areas of possible improvement.Lastly, sample predictions are plotted using Matplotlib. Random test images are chosen, and their predicted labels are plotted with the ground truth values to gauge the model's usability in real-world applications. To optimize performance, the notebook proposes potential improvements, including hyperparameter optimization, data augmentation, or leveraging advanced architectures like Transfer Learning. The implementation acts as a guide for practical applications for beginners and experts who wish to learn about image classification via deep learning. In total, this notebook follows a step-by-step process in creating an image classifier, with a focus on major concepts in deep learning, CNNs, and model performance in computer vision.
